      <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this homework, we implemented a geometric modeling system with polygon meshes with support for Bezier curves
        via de Casteljau's algorithm. Additionally, we implemented Phong shading by area weighted normal vectors of
        triangle meshes. Finally, we implemented mesh modification algorithms, such as edge flip, edge split, and
        upsampling via loop subdivision.

      <b>
        Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
      </b>
      <p>
        De Casteljau's algorithm is a popular technique to generate a point along a Bezier curve using repeated linear
        interpolation. Namely, the algorithm takes as input a set of points and a parameter tâˆˆ(0, 1). On each step,
        subdivide each line segment between two points using linear interpolation as P_new = (1 - t) * P1 + t * P2.
        Connect these new points and repeat the process until we remain with one resulting point. The
        technique can be extended to visualize the entire Bezier curve by sampling and connecting
        points along the curve using a variety of t values in the evaluation.

        In our implementation of a step of de Casteljau's algorithm in Part 1, we iterated through the set of input
        points and performed linear interpolation between adjacent points to retrieve the points for the next step to
        output.

        Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to

      </b>
      <p>
        De Casteljau's algorithm can be extended past the 1D environment and into 2D applications by performing the
        algorithm along both dimensions. Specifically, in our implementation, we used two paraameters for the repeated
        linear interpolation, u and v, for each of the dimensions, instead of a single parameter t. We evaluated each
        row of the points in the 2D n x n matrix of points along the u direction using de Casteljau's algorithm, which
        results in a 1D n x 1 set of points along the v direction, which were interpolated to a single point via a final
        evaluation using de Casteljau's algorithm.

      <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

      <b>
        Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
      </b>
      <p>
        To implement Phong shading, we computed the area-weighted vertex normal vectors by
        iterating through the faces incident to a vertex via the half edges along the face. While iterating over the
        half edges for a particular face, we gather the position of all three vertices
        of the triangle face and calculate the normal vector of the face by taking the cross product of two vectors
        representing two of the triangle face's sides (which can be calculated by taking vertex A's position - vertex
        B's position
        and vertex B's position - vertex C's position). Next, we can find the area of the face by taking half of the
        norm of the cross product area and we weight the normal vector by this area. We sum these area-weighted normal
        vectors from every face incident to a particular vertex and normalize it via the L2 norm.

        Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation /
        debugging tricks you have used.
      </b>
      <p>
        I first initialized variables for all necessary mesh elements (halfedge, vertex, face).
        Then it was a matter of carefully assigning the correct pointers for each mesh element.
        In edge flip, the main implementation is reassigning vertices (in the edge to flip), faces, and "next" pointers.
        An interesting implementation: I grouped mesh element pointer updates in a way that was easy for me to
        understand.
        For instance, faces were the easiest to update (only need change in halfedge pointer), so I updated faces first.
        Then I updated halfedge pointers.

        I first initialized variables for all necessary mesh elements (halfedge, vertex, face).
        I constructed all necessary mesh elements (a new vertex, two new triangles, three new edges, six new halfedges).
        An interesting implentation: I updated the pointers of new halfedges and old halfedges separately because they
        required different pointers to be changed and it was easier to conceptualize that way.

        I first iterated over each vertex, calculating new positions of original mesh vertices.

        Finally, I flipped all new edges (not belonging to original mesh edges) that had a new and old vertex.

        An interesting implementation: I stored neighboring vertices ABCD for each edge in a separate map, so that in
        calculations I could easily retrieve original mesh edges even after new edges were added by splitting.

        Subdivision creates new vertices at midpoints of each edge. Then every vertex (old and new) is averaged by by
        taking some weighted sum of neighboring vertices.
        The process of averaging reduces the sharpness of edges and corners, as neighboring vertices will be fairly
        distant from the sharp corner (thus the averaged new vertex will become closer to neighboring values, becoming
        dull and further away from the original position of the sharp corner).

        By pre-splitting edges, we generate more vertices. More vertices means more of the original shape will be
        preserved after subdividing. This reduces the effect of sharp corners become too dull, as the neighboring
        presplit vertices are closer to the sharp corner and better preserve the sharpness when the neighbors are
        averaged during subdivision.

        Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes
        slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so
        that
        the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your
        pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.

      <p>
        Subdivisions of the cube with and without pre-processing is shown in previous section.

        The cube is slightly asymmetric because the triangle themselves are asymmetric with respect to the 4 sides of
        the cube.
        If we wanted the cube to be subdivided in ideal symmetry, then each face should divided into four triangles
        instead of two (with two triangles per face, it basically cuts the cube face at a diagonal, asymmetric slant).
      </p>
      <p>
        With two triangles per face, some vertices of the cube are clearly split different from the other vertices of
        the cube (as the vertices have different edge counts and edge directions).
        By presplitting the face of the cube into four triangles, we alleviate the effects because no matter what angle
        we view the cube, all 8 vertices of the cube appear the same. This gives the cube a symmetric property in
        regards to each vertex, and subdividing it repeatedly will still preserve the symmetry across the vertices.
