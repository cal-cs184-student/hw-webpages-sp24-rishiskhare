		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this project, we implemented a realistic cloth simulation, with representations of the fabric's collisions with
			primitives in the scene, such as spheres and planes, and self-collisions with its own structure. We represent the
			cloth via a grid of springs and point masses. There was customization in terms of the density, damping, and spring
			constant (ks), which influenced the animation rendering and behavior of the cloth's movement and collisions. In
			addition, we incorporated vertex and fragment shaders for realistic lighting and shadows.
		</p>

		<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
	</a>
	<p>
		To initialize the spring-mass system, we first populated a grid of point masses with pinned points to represent the
		cloth's shape. Then, we connected neighboring point masses with springs in the grid. Point masses directly adjacent
		by one unit (directly above or to the left) are connected with a structural constraint spring. Point masses adjacent
		by two units (above by two units or to the left by two units) are connected with a bending constraint spring.
		Finally, point masses adjacent
		diagonally (above and to the left or above and to the right) are connected with a shearing constraint spring. In
		this way, the grid of point masses and springs allow for a spring-mass system which accurately depicts the
		characteristics of a rectangular cloth, with particular point masses on the cloth's surface being pinned in the
		scene.

		<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
	</a>
	<p>
		To simulate forces acting upon the cloth during rendering, we first added an external force vector to each point
		mass representing accelerations from the scene. Next, we used Hooke's law to compute the forces applied to a point
		mass from connected springs and accumulated the force vector for each point mass. Then, we used Verlet integration
		to compute the new positions of the point masses from the force applied. Finally, we applied some constraints on the
		positions on the point masses to account for pinned point masses remaining unchanged in position.
	</p>
	<blockquote><b>
			Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
			To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by
			pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again.
			You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.

				A high <code>ks</code>?
			</small>
		</b></blockquote>

	<p>
		The spring constant (ks) represents the spring's stiffness. A higher ks leads to a stiffer spring, and a lower ks
		corresponds to a weaker force spring. With a low ks value, we noticed that the cloth tended to lose its shape and be
		pulled apart more easily. Conversely, as we increased the ks value, we noticed the cloth tended to retain its shape
		and fold less drastically.

	<p>
		The density of the cloth was measured in g/cm^2. With low density values, the cloth tended to retain its shape and
		different parts of the cloth moved in unison during the animation. However, as the density was increased, different
		regions of the cloth tended to stay in motion and jiggle around during the animation and the cloth was looser in
		construction.

	<p>
		With a lower damping value, the cloth animation progressed much more quickly and the cloth moved with more downward

		to rest. As the damping value increased, the cloth fell more gracefully and with less force.

		The spring constant (ks) influenced the rigidity of the cloth (as ks increases, the cloth retains its shape more and

		increases, the cloth tends to move with less force and the animation tends to come to rest at a slower rate.

			<small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>
		</b></blockquote>

	<p>
		ks, the spring constant, describes the stiffness of the cloth. If a cloth is more stiff, then it will resist the
		effect of forces more.
		When ks = 50,000, because the cloth is so stiff, the cloth resists the force of gravity and tries to maintain the
		tangent angle at which the cloth stopped touching the sphere's surface.
		When ks = 500, the cloth is quite fluid, so gravity pulls the cloth down all the way, making the creases of the
		cloth almost completely vertical.
		When ks = 5000, the cloth is not to stiff and not to fluid, mostly (but not compeletely) pulled down by gravity.

		Higher density means each point mass in the cloth is heavier. When density = 50, the points are so heavy that
		gravity tends to pull it straight down, making the cloth clump up and have much more folding.
		In contrast, when density = 1, the points are light, so gravity affects the cloth less. When the cloth collides with
		the ground, the collision force between the point masses causes the points to spread apart to the sides
		horizontally. As a result, there is less clumping.

			Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create
			lighting and material effects.
		</b></blockquote>

	<p>
		A shader program changes the appearance of objects by affecting the output in different steps of the graphics
		pipeline, like when processing vertices or fragments. Shaders run on the GPU. Vertex shaders can change vertex
		properties like normals and position, and it can send properties to the fragment shader for further manipulation.
		Fragment shaders change the apperance of fragments on the screen, like color. By manipulating the vertex properties,
		the material's surface can appear bumpy or light can collide the surface in different ways. Or by changing the
		color, the texture and reflected light of the material can appear different.

			model.
		</b></blockquote>

	<p>
		The Blinn-Phong shading model attempts to recreate the elements of light as we see it in the real world.
		Usually, when a light hits an object, we see some highlights (specular), reflection from surfaces (diffuse), and
		background light (ambient lighting).
		By combining these types of light, we are able to create more realistic lighting.

	<p>
		Bump mapping imitates a bumpy, non-smooth smooth by calculating color and lighting using a displaced normal. Only
		the surface color changes, while the surface vertices remain in their default position.
		As we can see in the render, the surface maintains its smooth flatness and only the surface color changed, imitating
		bumps by coloring in shadows and light.
	</p>
	<p>
		Displacement mapping physically creates a bumpy, non-smooth surface by physically moving vertices. In addition, it
		displaces the normal to alter surface color just like bump mapping.
		As we can see in the render, the surface geometry is physically altered and has bumps and crevices that align with
		the shadows and light.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the coarser mesh, both shaders look less blurry (has more contrasts) and more detailed (espeically in the lines
		and lighting) due to the higher resolution, although displacement mapping is more noticeable.
		In displacement mapping, even the physical bumps along the surface and folds of the cloth are more pronounced in the
		coarse mesh.
